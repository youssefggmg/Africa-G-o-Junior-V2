## Features

### **User Stories**
1. **Designer Tasks**:
   - Correct and improve the use case diagram from version 1.
   - Create a UML class diagram representing the application's structure.

2. **Back-End Developer Tasks**:
   - Implement an OOP architecture for the following entities:
     - **Continent**: `ID`, `Nom`, `Nombre de pays`.
     - **Country**: `ID_Pays`, `Nom_Pays`, `Population_Pays`, `Langue_Pays`, `Continent associ√©`.
     - **City**: `IDCity`, `Name_City`, `Description_City`, `Type_City` (capital or other), `Associated country`.

   - Develop PHP classes with these functionalities:
     - User/Admin authentication.
     - Add a continent, country, or city along with their information.
     - Modify or delete continents, countries, or cities.
     - View lists of continents, countries, and cities with their details.
